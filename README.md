## Why an Anime site?

Growing up my step-brothers and I would often watch things like *Dragon Ball* or *Pokemon* instead of shows on the Disney channel or things of that nature.
While I don't watch anime all too often, many of my friends do and I get to hear about the newest show they're watching all the time. Often these shows
are something that sounds awful like *[Reborn as a Vending Machine, I Now Wander the Dungeon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52619/Jidou_Hanbaiki_ni_Umarekawatta_Ore_wa_Meikyuu_wo_Samayou)*
and I can't help but look it up to see the ratings. The issue with some of these sites that you can get all this viewer-given data from is that they are often unappealing to the eye or full
of ads, so, with the help of the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/), I made a simple site that can get you the information you want without having to jump through hoops to get to!

## How to use

- Download the .zip
- Open in your preferred IDE
- Run the site (I use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Simply type in the show you're looking for and click search!
