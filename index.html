<!-- 
    AnimeExplorer uses the Jikan API (https://jikan.moe/) to search for anime listed on MyAnimeList!

    This is a simple web app that allows users to search for anime and get information about them.
    Often when you are looking up information about a show, you can be met with a mass of information
        including spoilers, AnimeExplorer is available for you to give the simple & important information
        about a show!

    The reasoning behind the coding of this simple web app is to refamiliarize myself with querying API's
        and to put some work into my CSS skills. I have been working on a lot of backend projects recently
        through school and CSS often gets put on the back-burner, so I decided to code something small to 
        test out some front-end that would be fitting of a web app that people would like using!
